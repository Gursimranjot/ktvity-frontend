                                        It’s not easy to design for simplicity. It’s not supposed to be. Your job as a
                                        UX designer is to dig deep into the complexities of everything from user goals
                                        to system constraints in order to output a beautiful and easy to use design that
                                        will help users achieve their goals effortlessly. To get started on the path to
                                        simplicity and incorporate them into your designs, be sure to:

                                        </li>

                                        The weather widget, mentioned in the previous section, has a very narrow “gulf
                                        of execution” as the number of aims (e.g., looking up local weather information)
                                        are low and the means of achieving them is small. On the other hand, the Weather
                                        Channel website has a wider “gulf of execution” as the number of aims of the
                                        user remain the same but the means of achieving them is widely varied.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Increasing the number of means of achieving a limited number of system goals
                                        creates needless complication. Successful systems are designed with the user’s
                                        primary goal(s) in mind and take into consideration the limits
                                        of human memory and the amount of attention allocated to each goal.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Comparing the Gulf of Execution of a weather website to that of a weather
                                        widget, you can see how a simpler user interface can lead to a narrower Gulf of
                                        Execution. The wider the gulf of execution, the higher chance your users will
                                        give up using your product.
                                        Designers should always strive for a narrow Gulf of Execution.
